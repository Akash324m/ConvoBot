# ConvoBot
Terminal-Based AI Conversational Agent.

## 📜 Project Overview

ConvoSphere is a lightweight, terminal-based AI chatbot designed to facilitate natural language conversations without requiring complex server infrastructure or web interfaces. The system leverages Python and the OpenAI API to simulate basic conversational responses, making it ideal for simple, offline interactions.

---

## ✅ Objectives

* Develop a functional AI chatbot that operates entirely through the terminal.
* Implement basic NLP techniques to generate contextual responses.
* Maintain a minimal, resource-efficient architecture without external server dependencies.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python** (Primary Programming Language)
* **OpenAI API** (For Generating Responses)
* **NLTK** (Optional for Basic NLP Processing)
* **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** (Development and Testing)
* **Terminal/Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/convosphere.git
   cd convosphere
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

3. **Set Up OpenAI API Key:**

   * Create an OpenAI account and obtain an API key.
   * Open the Python file and replace the placeholder with your API key:

     ```python
     openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
     ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd convosphere
   ```

2. Run the chatbot program:

   ```bash
   python convosphere.py
   ```

3. Interact with the chatbot through the terminal:

   * Type your queries and receive AI-generated responses.
   * Type `exit` to terminate the session.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

* **Function: `generate_response()`**: Processes user inputs and generates responses using the OpenAI API.
* **Function: `start_chat()`**: Initiates the chatbot loop for continuous interaction.

## 📝 Example Conversation

```
ConvoSphere: Hi! How can I assist you today?
You: What is AI?
ConvoSphere: AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
You: exit
ConvoSphere: Take care! Goodbye!
```

## ⚡ Future Enhancements

* Implement basic NLP processing using NLTK or spaCy.
* Integrate additional response modes (e.g., sentiment analysis, contextual memory).
* Enhance the command-line interface with better formatting and response handling.
